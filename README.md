### 📝 Summary
The National Student Clearinghouse Research Center and some states show an “unprecedented” decline in college enrollment among high school graduates, Prospects for the graduating Class of 2021 did not appear much better;  preliminary data from the clearinghouse show ​​freshman enrollment declined 2.7 percent from last fall—13.1 percent since 2019. Overall postsecondary enrollment for fall 2021 is running 2.6 percent below 2020’s level, for a total 5.8 percent drop since 2019. 

Why are recent high school graduates not going to college?

Many of those who didn’t enroll or complete degrees say college was too expensive and also cite stress of career uncertainty. Furthermore, the education marketplace is fundamentally different today than it has been in the past: Prospective students have more educational options than ever before, and they make decisions based on a pathway’s value, tradeoffs and required investment. College’s traditional value proposition as a place to explore and find a passion isn’t cutting it in many cases.
Why is this important to know?
It’s important to know you don’t need a college degree to be successful. The truth is, employers hire based on skill. Plenty of successful people don’t have college degrees, for example mechanics, electricians, carpenters, and plumbers, all of which have relatively good salaries and offer a great deal of independence. You’ll be at least $100,000 ahead of your college-bound peers. Moral of this, we all have options other than college to be successful.

Through this project, our focus is BICOP who have decided not to attend college. We aim to provide assistance by using PathWay together, we can influence change and find careers that don't require a college degree by using our information-based application. By making an account recent graduates can select a trade school, a workforce development program, or even a nonprofit. They’ll be prepared for their desired careers through features such as being given a clear road map that would show as a guide of tasks needed to accomplish inorder to acquire the desired certification as well as being matched with a mentor in the career of their choice and communication through live chat and video calls, making it easier to prepare for any interviews or unforeseen obstacles.

### 😞 The Problem 
Our society doesn't generally encourage career paths other than a college degree, and as a result, high school graduates looking for careers without a college degree lack guidance on how to find them. Furthermore, there was a study between 2019 and 2020 which found about 24% of full-time undergraduates dropped out of college during their first year, and 36.5% of high school graduates did not go to college. We want to instill change so that high-school graduates can find alternative programs to colleges. Also, The cost of college has steadily increased over the last 30 years. In that timeframe, tuition costs at public four-year colleges grew from $4,160 to $10,740 and from $19,360 to $38,070 making it unaffordable for lower-middle-class students.
